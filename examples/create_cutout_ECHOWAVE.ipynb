    "The repository contains datasets for multiple years, ranging from 1990 to 2021 for the region of North-West Europe. A downloaded ECHOWAVE dataset contains extensive information on wave, wind and currents variables and more. For the purposes of the `mrel_wave` module only two wave components are used: `hs: wave height (m)`, and `fp: peak wave frequency (Hz)` (which is transformed into `tp: wave peak period (m)`). These provide the combinations of climate variables used in the `Power_Matrix` to convert metocean data to power.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notes**:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. For creating a cutout from this dataset, you need to download large files and your computers memory needs to be able to handle these as well.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. The `era5` module has been updated aswell to include the same wave variables under the `wave` feature, so a user has the option to use wave energy converters with an ERA5 dataset. Their memory usage is significantly lower as the grid resolution is also lower."

    "Comparing it with the ERA5 dataset, which has a resolution of 0.3 degrees, we see that the gaps of ECHOWAVE near the shores are smaller, but also the level of accuracy is higher. In the picture below, which shows Northern Ireland, we can see that the incoming waves from the Atlantic have significantly higher wave height `hs` values in the ECHOWAVE dataset, while those resources can reach the coasts of the island. On the other hand ERA5, has a difficulty showcasing both coastline and resource accuracy. This is a significant improvement for wave device deployment as it increases their availability.\n"
